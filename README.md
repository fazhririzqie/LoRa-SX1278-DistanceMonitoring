# LoRa-SX1278-DistanceMonitoring
Remote Monitoring of Lights Using LoRa-SX1278 Arduino Module
This project uses several Arduino modules such as the LoRa SX-1278, Arduino Uno (Receiver), Arduino Nano (Transmitter), 128x64 OLED LCD, a switch, and a relay to activate the lights.This project is not yet integrated with IoT, but you can certainly turn it into an IoT project by replacing the switch with an IoT application and swapping the Arduino with one that includes WiFi.
