# LoRa-SX1278-DistanceMonitoring
Remote Monitoring of Lights Using LoRa-SX1278 Arduino Module.

This project uses several Arduino modules such as the LoRa SX-1278, Arduino Uno (Receiver), Arduino Nano (Transmitter), 128x64 OLED LCD, a switch, and a relay to activate the lights. This project is not yet integrated with IoT, but you can certainly turn it into an IoT project by replacing the switch with an IoT application and swapping the Arduino with one that includes WiFi.

For the Schematic Diagram, you can refer to the one provide below:

The first is for Transmitter, and the second is for Receiver

The LoRa SX1278 can reach distances of over 1 km in open fields with no interference.
